📈 VIF — The Multicollinearity Detector
“When your predictors start echoing each other, VIF calls them out.” 😅🔍

Imagine trying to predict house prices using square footage, total area, and number of rooms. If those features are too similar, your model gets confused. That’s where VIF steps in.

<details> <summary>📚 What Is VIF?</summary>

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) quantifies how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity.

Mathematically:

VIF
𝑖
=
1
1
−
𝑅
𝑖
2
Where:

𝑅
𝑖
2
 is the R-squared value when feature 
𝑖
 is regressed on all other features.

🔍 Interpretation:

| VIF Value | Meaning                                 |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| 1         | No multicollinearity                    |
| 1–5       | Moderate correlation (usually okay)     |
| >5        | Potential multicollinearity             |
| >10       | Serious multicollinearity—fix it!       |

<details> <summary>🧪 Python Example: Detecting VIF</summary>

python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor

# Sample dataset
data = {
    'sqft': [1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000],
    'total_area': [1100, 1600, 2100, 2600, 3100],  # Highly correlated with sqft
    'bedrooms': [2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate VIF for each feature
vif_data = pd.DataFrame()
vif_data['Feature'] = df.columns
vif_data['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(df.values, i) for i in range(df.shape[1])]

print(vif_data)
🧠 Output Insight:
You’ll likely see high VIF for sqft and total_area—they’re too similar. That’s multicollinearity in action.

<details> <summary>🧰 How to Fix High VIF</summary>

🧹 Drop one of the correlated features

🧪 Combine them into a new feature (e.g., sqft_per_bedroom)

🧼 Use PCA to reduce dimensionality

🧠 Try Ridge or Lasso Regression to regularize coefficients

<details> <summary>🎯 Real-Life Example</summary>

Let’s say you’re building a model to predict car price using:

Engine size

Horsepower

Torque

These features often correlate heavily. VIF helps you spot which ones are redundant so your model doesn’t get confused.
