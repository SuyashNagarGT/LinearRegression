📏 Understanding R-Squared in Multiple Linear Regression
R-squared (R²) is a key metric in regression analysis. It tells us how well the independent variables explain the variation in the dependent variable.

🔍 What Does R-Squared Represent?

R² = 0 → The model explains none of the variability in the outcome.
R² = 1 → The model explains all the variability perfectly.
Higher R² → Better fit of the model to the data.


💡 Think of R² as a percentage:
If R² = 0.85, then 85% of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the model.


📈 Behavior of R-Squared

✅ Always increases when you add more predictors — even if they’re not useful.
⚠️ This can be misleading! That’s why we also use Adjusted R², which accounts for the number of predictors.


📌 Example
Let’s say we’re predicting house prices using:

Size of the house
Location
Number of bedrooms

If our model gives R² = 0.90, it means:

🏠 90% of the variation in house prices is explained by these predictors.

📊 Adjusted R-Squared: A Smarter Metric
While R-squared (R²) tells us how well the model fits the data, it has a major flaw:

🔺 R² always increases when you add more predictors — even if they’re irrelevant!

That’s where Adjusted R-squared comes in.

🔍 What is Adjusted R-Squared?
Adjusted R² modifies the R² value by penalizing the model for adding predictors that don’t improve the model significantly.
It answers the question:

“Does adding this predictor actually help explain the outcome better?”


📐 Formula (Conceptual)
Adjusted R² = 1 - [(1 - R²) * (n - 1) / (n - k - 1)]

Where:

n = number of observations
k = number of predictors


✅ Why Use Adjusted R²?

📌 Example
Let’s say you build two models:

Model A: R² = 0.85, Adjusted R² = 0.83
Model B: R² = 0.87, Adjusted R² = 0.82

Even though Model B has a higher R², its Adjusted R² is lower, meaning it might be overfitting or using unnecessary predictors.

⚠️ Key Takeaway

Use Adjusted R² when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.
It helps you choose a model that is both accurate and efficient.

✅ Summary

R² measures model fit — how well your predictors explain the outcome.
Higher R² is better, but not always meaningful.
Use Adjusted R² for comparing models with different numbers of predictors.
