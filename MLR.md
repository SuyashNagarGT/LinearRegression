üìä Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical method used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables (predictors).

üîç What Are Multiple Predictors?
A predictor is a variable that helps explain or predict the outcome. In MLR, we use multiple predictors to improve the accuracy of our predictions.
Example predictors for predicting a student's final exam score:

Hours studied
Attendance rate
Number of assignments completed


üìê MLR Equation
MarkdownY = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅX‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇX‚ÇÇ + ... + Œ≤‚ÇôX‚Çô + ŒµShow more lines
Where:

Y = Dependent variable (e.g., final exam score)
X‚ÇÅ, X‚ÇÇ, ..., X‚Çô = Independent variables (predictors)
Œ≤‚ÇÄ = Intercept (value of Y when all Xs are 0)
Œ≤‚ÇÅ, Œ≤‚ÇÇ, ..., Œ≤‚Çô = Coefficients (impact of each predictor)
Œµ = Error term (difference between predicted and actual values)


üìà Understanding Coefficients (Œ≤)
Each coefficient (Œ≤) tells us how much the dependent variable changes when the predictor increases by one unit, keeping other predictors constant.
Example:
MarkdownFinal_Score = 40 + 5*(Hours_Studied) + 3*(Attendance_Rate)Show more lines

Œ≤‚ÇÅ = 5: For every additional hour studied, the final score increases by 5 points (assuming attendance stays the same).
Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 3: For every 1% increase in attendance, the final score increases by 3 points (assuming study hours stay the same).

If a coefficient is negative, it means the predictor has a negative impact on the outcome.

üìå Significance of Increase or Decrease

A positive coefficient means the predictor increases the outcome.
A negative coefficient means the predictor decreases the outcome.
The magnitude of the coefficient shows how strong the effect is.
Statistical significance (often measured by p-values) tells us whether the predictor is reliably affecting the outcome or if it might be due to chance.


‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of MLR

Linearity Assumption: Assumes a straight-line relationship between predictors and outcome.
Multicollinearity: Predictors should not be highly correlated with each other.
Outliers: Extreme values can distort the model.
Homoscedasticity: Assumes constant variance of errors across all levels of predictors.
Overfitting: Too many predictors can make the model fit the training data too well but perform poorly on new data.


‚úÖ Summary
Multiple Linear Regression is a powerful tool for prediction and understanding relationships between variables. However, it's important to check assumptions and interpret coefficients carefully to ensure reliable results.
