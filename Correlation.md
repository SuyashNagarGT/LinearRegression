🔗 Correlation — When Variables Start Syncing Their Dance Moves
“Just because two things move together doesn’t mean one’s leading the tango.” 💃📈

Ever noticed how your caffeine intake and stress levels rise together? That’s correlation—a statistical way of saying, “These two variables seem to vibe.”

<details> <summary>📚 What Is Correlation?</summary>

Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

📈 Positive correlation: Both variables increase together

📉 Negative correlation: One increases while the other decreases

⚖️ No correlation: They do their own thing

It’s quantified by the correlation coefficient 
𝑟
, which ranges from -1 to +1:

−
1
≤
𝑟
≤
+
1
Value of 
𝑟
Interpretation
+1	Perfect positive correlation
0	No linear correlation
-1	Perfect negative correlation

<details> <summary>🧪 How Do You Calculate It?</summary>

The most common method is the Pearson correlation coefficient:

𝑟
=
∑
(
𝑋
−
𝑋
ˉ
)
(
𝑌
−
𝑌
ˉ
)
∑
(
𝑋
−
𝑋
ˉ
)
2
∑
(
𝑌
−
𝑌
ˉ
)
2
Where:

𝑋
,
𝑌
 are your variables

𝑋
ˉ
,
𝑌
ˉ
 are their means

The numerator captures how they move together

The denominator normalizes the scale

<details> <summary>📊 Real-Life Examples</summary>

☕ Caffeine vs. Stress

🧠 Study hours vs. Exam scores

🏠 House size vs. Price

🎧 Music volume vs. productivity (debatable 😅)

Just remember: correlation ≠ causation. Your stress might correlate with meetings, but it doesn’t mean meetings cause stress (…or does it?).

    'stress_level': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
    'sleep_hours': [8, 7, 6, 5, 4]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df.corr())
